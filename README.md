## Frequently Asked Questions

Q. Why is my browser asking to access my location?
A. Where's Mason uses GPS to calculate where you are and how far it is to the next
   location. Android and iOS require the user to approve this, and do not allow a
   website to have permanent permission to location data. So unfortunately, every check
   in will generate this popup.
