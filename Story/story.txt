Mason Smith is missing. He disappeared about a week ago. Mason loved 
history and he told you that he was on his his way to visit Harrisburg 
Pennsylvania to learn about its history.

He was reported missing, and so far the police have had no luck finding him.
Today, you received a message on your phone that said:

    "They are after me."
    "I can't let them find me"
    "Meet me at the Capitol Steps, hurry.."

Capitol Steps 40.26401, -76.88480

When you get to the steps of the Capitol, you find a notebook. The notebook
old and as you flip through the pages, you recognize Mason's handwriting. On 
the inside of the back cover you find something scribbled by Mason, but it is 
sloppy and looks like it was written in a hurry:

    "If you're reading this, go to the church that's also a holiday"

St. Patrick Cathedral 40.26368, -76.88666

Upon arriving in front of St. Patrick Catherdral you do not see anyone 
matching Mason's description. Looking around you notice a flyer on a building
wall. It is a religious flying that reads "Are you lost and looking to 
find your way to salvation?"  It is filled with the excepted religous info
about finding Jesus, but on the back of the flyer, you once again see Mason's
handwriting it reads:

    "Young man, there's no need to feel down"
